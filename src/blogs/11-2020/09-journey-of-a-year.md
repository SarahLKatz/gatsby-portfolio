My first year at quartet

"Here's the day you hoped would never come
Don't feed me violins
Just run with me through rows of speeding cars.
The papercuts, the cheating lovers
The coffee's never strong enough
I know you think it's more than just bad luck."
- Imogen Heap, _Speeding Cars_

This is a song that at its core may not seem appropriate for celebrating a milestone, but for me this song has always been a great reminder for new beginnings. Things can be hard, but those same things can also be an adventure. We all struggle, we all face difficulties, but sometimes that's just the way it goes. You just have to keep going.

In a lot of ways, that's how I've seen my first year at my current job. I've had difficulties and struggles. There have been moments where I doubted myself and my role on the team. Whether I wondered whether I'd do better in a different role or on a different team or at a different company. There were days when I was very down on myself. But there were also good days. Days when I felt successful. Days when I saw growth in myself. Days when I saw a future for myself at this company. Days when I felt like I belonged.
