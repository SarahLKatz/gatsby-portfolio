title: "Things Are Different This Time: A Second Job Search"

In early 2018, when I was looking for my first development job, I only had two onsite interviews - and both of them led to offers. I know it's a small sample size, but it felt good to know that any time a company brought me to their office, they liked me and my qualifications enough to offer me a position. Fast forward to a year later. Due to the work I had been doing at my last job, I'm not as confident in my skills and qualifications in this search, so continuing this streak and getting an offer from every onsite would be a huge confidence booster.

I had an onsite interview last week, and while I didn't feel like it went very well, I still had hope that my streak would continue. After all, I felt like my technical phone screen with this company didn't go very well, and I was still invited for an onsite. So I held out hope and was looking forward to hearing from them on Monday.

Monday came ... and no news. Tuesday ... same thing. On Thursday afternoon I decided that if I hadn't heard back by a week after the interview - which was Friday morning - I would email my contact and ask. So I did, and was told that they decided to move forward with other candidates. So ... streak broken.

Surprisingly (or maybe not) ... I'm okay. Based on the fact that I had to ask for an answer, I figured a second interview wasn't likely. And honestly, I didn't expect my "all onsites lead to an offer" streak to last through this job search. All good things must come to and end eventually ... and 2-1 is really not a bad record.

I want this job search to be different than my last one. I don't want to accept an offer just because it makes financial sense. I want to find a job that I love and where I'm excited to go into work every day. And if I go on a lot of onsite interviews and only get offers from a smaller percentage of the companies this time, I'm more than okay with that. I'm okay going into an office for an interview and then never being asked to come back again. As long as I get an offer from the right job, anything that happens before then is just an opportunity to learn a lesson.
