A little less than two weeks ago, I was informed that my time on my current project was up and I was given two weeks notice. I was a little upset, because nobody likes being fired, but at the end of the day, I’m totally okay with it.

From the very start, some things about this job were not ideal. I’m still not 100% sure where the miscommunication happened (although I have some theories), but I had a different impression than the company did about what my long term role would be. When I realized that they had no intentions of moving me to a new project (which I thought they would), I asked to be moved — and was given answers varying from “we don’t know where to put you” to “that’s not what you were hired for.” At the end of the day, there was no room there for me to be doing the work I wanted to do, so it’s better for me to not be working there than to continue working on a project that I hate and that was not relevant to my long-term goals.

I also did not feel like I was growing at all in this job. In the first few months, I learned a new skill (one which may not be relevant to me in the future, but it’s always good to know more than you need). But I feel like I haven’t learned much since then and I don’t feel like I’ve grown significantly as a developer, which is one of the reasons that I had started exploring other options even before I was let go. I knew when I started that this wasn’t going to be my forever job, and I needed to be growing in some way to get me closer to finding that forever job. Now I have that opportunity.

As far as “firings” go, this wasn’t a bad one. It was made clear to me that the reason I was let go was not because of the quality of my work or anything about me personally. As hard as it was to leave my awesome coworkers, I’m not going to miss the frustration I had with my work. And I know that my next job will be better. Because I will make sure that I find something better.

When I first took this job, I wasn’t in love with it, but I wanted to be working and I thought it would grow into a job I loved. Now I know better. I’m fortunate enough to be in a position where I can take some time to find the right job, so I’m going to do just that. If I’m offered a job that I don’t think I will love, I know now that it’s okay to say no. If I’m not excited about the job before I get there, I’m not going to love it once I’m there. So I want to take the time to find the right job, not just a job. I want a job where I can work to solve problems, where I can actually see the impact of my work, and where I can constantly learn and grow. Somewhere where I can see the difference I’m making for my company … even if that difference is something as simple as saving someone else 2 hours in their development process.

Job searching is going to be a tough process. It always is. But I’m optimistic for the future and looking forward to finding out what opportunities are out there for me.
