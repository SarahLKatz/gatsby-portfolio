short term vs long term

As I write this blog post, I'm preparing for a bit of a change at work. **

transitioning to a new team
- moving away from a team where I previously had (but dont currently have) a lot of responsibility and to a larger team with more senior engineers
- am I "losing" status in the short term to help me with my long term growth? Or am I giving up the potential for quicker short-term growth and putting myself on a longer path to long-term growth?
- manager will be trying to give me work to help me grow
