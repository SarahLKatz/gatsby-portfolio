** INTRO

My first introduction to my company's focus on feedback came in my second week at the job, during our all-company onsite event. We had a feedback workshop as one of our sessions, and while I remember appreciating that session when it happened, I also don't remember anything that was discussed in that presentation. While I don't remember what I was supposed to be learning about feedback (in my defense, having an all-company onsite the week after my onboarding made everything extra overwhelming), I did walk away understanding that my company was working to foster a positive and productive feedback culture.

When setting my goals for 2020, I was encouraged to set a goal around feedback and culture (it was part of the company guideline for goals). I was setting my goals for the first half of the year just as I got assigned to a new manager (who was herself new to managing), so I thought a good feedback goal would be to give feedback to my new manager at a regular cadence. That didn't go so well (it turns out I'm not great at knowing when to give feedback or what feedback to give), so for the second half of the year, I set a more concrete goal - adding one positive comment to our retro at the end of every sprint. I also set a secondary goal of giving feedback to my team outside of our retrospective. I did okay with the retro goal (some sprints I was working on things independent of most of my team's work so I didn't have a lot to add), but failed at giving feedback outside of retro. I went into the year wanting to get better at giving feedback, and it didn't feel like my goals helped me get there.

- LinkedIn Learning Course
  - why linkedin learning - I've been doing a lot of LinkedIn Learning courses for professional development (at first using my NYPL subscription, and now I have access through work), and I realized one day that if I want to be good at giving feedback, maybe the answer is learning more about feedback and giving feedback - so I decided to check out LinkedIn Learning
  - didn't fully absorb it, so I will watch it again and take notes (was gonna do it this week but got distracted by a course on CSS Grid)
- Feedback Notebook
  - Positive Feedback - what the feedback was and how it made me feel
  - Negative Feedback - what the feedback was and what I can learn from it
- If my company asks us to do a feedback goal this year, my goal will be to learn more about feedback (probably will set a measurable goal around LinkedIn Learning courses), because I want it to be something I fully understand and embrace as a part of my work journey, not something I'm forcing myself to do
