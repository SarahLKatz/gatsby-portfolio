** INTRO
- company emphasis on feedback 
- why that matters to me

My first introduction to my company's focus on feedback came in my second week at the job, during our all-company onsite event. We had a feedback workshop as one of our sessions, and while I remember appreciating that session when it happened, I also don't remember anything that was discussed in that presentation. While I don't remember what I was supposed to be learning about feedback (in my defense, having an all-company onsite the week after my onboarding made everything extra overwhelming), I did walk away understanding that my company was working to foster a positive and productive feedback culture.

When setting my goals for 2020, I was encouraged to set a goal around feedback and culture (it was part of the company guideline for goals). I was setting my goals for the first half of the year just as I got assigned to a new manager (who was herself new to managing), so I thought a good feedback goal would be to give feedback to my new manager at a regular cadence. That didn't go so well (it turns out I'm not great at knowing when to give feedback or what feedback to give), so for the second half of the year, I set a more concrete goal - adding one positive comment to our retro at the end of every sprint. I also set a secondary goal of giving feedback to my team outside of our retrospective. I did okay with the retro goal (some sprints I was working on things independent of most of my team's work so I didn't have a lot to add), but failed at giving feedback outside of retro. I went into the year wanting to get better at giving feedback, and it didn't feel like my goals helped me get there.

Some of my professional learning over the last year or so has been based around courses on LinkedIn Learning, and I realized recently that I can use that as a tool to help me learn more about feedback. I believe that learning more about feedback and how to give (and receive) feedback will help me develop better feedback habits, and if my company asks me to set a feedback-related goal this year, my goal will likely be to learn more about feedback (most likely measured by setting a number of LinkedIn Learning courses to watch). I've searched the platform for courses about feedback and there are quite a few courses for me to choose from. So far I've watched one course on giving and receiving feedback, but I don't felt like I fully absorbed it, so I plan to watch it again soon and take notes.

Watching that first course has already given me an idea for how to better embrace feedback. I know that to truly grow from receiving feedback (and to grow into someone who can give productive feedback), I need to absorb feedback that is given to me and understand how to use it to improve my work. I am planning to create a "feedback notebook", where I write down the feedback that I receive from my co-workers. For each piece of feedback, I want to first determine if I see it as positive or negative feedback. For positive feedback, I want to include a note about how it made me feel, which gives me something to look back on when I'm struggling to see my contributions to the company. For negative feedback, I want to write down what I can learn from that feedback and what steps I can take to ensure that I don't receive the same feedback again.

I know that making feedback a regular part of my work routine will have positive long-term impacts on my work and my career growth. Learning to better absorb feedback and understanding what I can learn from each piece of feedback can help me grow into a better developer and a better collaborator.

** CONCLUSION
- Need to be able to absorb feedback and use it to help me grow
- Build a feedback culture to help the company improve overall (and also to help ensure that I'm getting the most effective feedback by building a culture around better feedback)
